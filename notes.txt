Aim: Bootstrap

Front-end frameworks:
    -> foundation
    -> Bootstrap

As a duo, look up either the bootstrap or foundation front end framework and:
* research framework
* create a single HTML page that demonstrates:
    > the key features of your framework
    > it should not be too complicated; you don't need to showcase EVERYTHING about the framework
    > highlight the most attractive or useful features of your framework
    > your page should provide a simpler on-ramp than the site

Cascading style sheets (css)
    * created to separate presentation of an HTML/XML Page from its contents
    * not limited to web pages(paper, etc)
    * though HTML tags like <center> exist, you should henceforth avoid them
    * 3 ways to style css:
        * inline
        * internal style sheet
        * external style sheets

Basic syntax:
    > Property: value;
    Eg:
        color: light blue;
        border: 100px;

> Inline styling:
    * syntax: <TAG stle="CSS CODE">
        eg: <p stle="color:green">
    * add CSS code to the style attribute of HTML tag
    * good for trying things out
    * .... but tedious if we want all of them to look the same, its tedious to
      retype them over and over

> Internal Style sheets
    * add a STYLE element to the section of the page
    * include all CSS code inside the <style ... </style> block
    * requires addition of a selector so that it is clear what element you are styling
    * SYNTAX:
        SELECTOR {
            CSS CODE;
        }
    eg:
    h1 {
        color: #FF00FF; // this is purple(red + blue)
    }

> External Style Sheets
    * create a separate .css file that contains all of your CSS code
    * it cannot contain any other kind of code(no HTML or XML)
    * include a link to the CSS file inside the section of the HEAD section of your page
    * SYNTAX:
    eg:
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="STYLE FILE" type="text/css">
    </head>

> GO GO WEB browser INSPECT!
    * right click and select inspect
    * interact with styles wihout having to touch them

> the DIV tag
... is a container element. Sole purpose is to define a section of your page that should be considered grouped together

> Class attribute
... is an identifier that can be applied to multiple elements. Any HTML element can have this.
    eg:
    <div class="navbar"> ... </div>
    <h2 class="new_chapter"> ... </h2>

    To access these classes in your CSS file, put a period in front of the class name:
    eg:
        .new_chapter {
            text-align: center;
        }
> ID Attributes
HTML elements can also have an ID attribute(identifier to be applied ONLY TO A SINGLE ELEMENT)
    eg:
        <div id="main_content"> ... </div>
To use a aselector in your CSS flies,
put a #(octothorp) in front of the ID tag
    eg:
        #main_content {
            text-align: center;
        }

> PROTIP:
    you can use ID Names in tags as href target to jump around the same pages
    eg:
        <a href="#main_content">... </a>
