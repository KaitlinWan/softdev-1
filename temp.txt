**Aim:** REST up

**API:** Application Program Interface

* published set of protocols that can be used to have your program interact with some other program/service
* examples:
    * Python API (Documentation)
    * Java API
    * Netlogo DOcumentation API
* not solely geared for programmers
* when we wrote an info tab for netlogo project, that is kind of an API
* declaring an interface in Java -> API
*
**REST:** **Re**presentative **S**tate **T**ransfer

* a REST API transmits data back after receiving an http(s) request
* returned data can be in various formats. Most common are HTML, XML, JSON
* often require a **key**(why?)
* we're gonna focus on JSON format
* read up on **Wikipedia** representative state transfer

**json** library facilitates ork with JSON data

* ```.loads()``` turns a JSON object string into a dictionary
* ```.dumps()``` turns python dict into JSON object string. EG: ```w = json.dumps(<DICTIONARY>)```
